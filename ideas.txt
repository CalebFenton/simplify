This is a scratch pad for ideas.
Many of them are too undercooked or too broad to be articulated as issues on github.


add time limits to methods

toggle optimizers



rewrite option handling to use apache cmdline handler
    change to <input dex / apk> [options]
    add example for -it option, uses com/package not com.package


move side effects out of ops and into execution nodes
the op is shared between all nodes at a location
record side effect information the node

replace all methodDescriptors internally with methodreferences
this is to keep string duplication down


-i sandbox/hubert/hubert_sample.apk -it 'Lcom/i_manager/ajroute/c;->a\(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/Boolean;Ljava/lang/Integer;\)Ljava/lang/Integer;' -v
has this, which should be considered dead, needs to be specifically white listed
v0 is "assigned" since it's an instance and could have changed, but v0 is never used
    #@1f
    invoke-virtual {v0}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->toString()Ljava/lang/String;


Emulate System.exit() to halt the thread

During execution, the context has no awareness of the current method or the call stack. Knowing these things allows for:
  1.) illegal access checks on fields, right now, no way to tell if the field is in the same class as the current method
  2.) contextualized exception throwing with stack trace
* update - execution context of first op in method has callerContext and callerAddress, which can be traced back up to rebuild call stack

Beef up whitelist:
  many Class.is*

Emulate:
  Ljava/lang/reflect/Method;->invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
  invoke ourselves or run emulated method


Android class lifecycle initialization
  sometimes it can be assumed onCreate has been called
  or just give a list of methods to be called before whatever else

  java -jar simplify/build/libs/simplify-0.1.0-all.jar -i 7604399 -it 'PornApplication;->i2c1cqop3faop3cdhokggmd97ce\(\)'
  ArrayLists are initialized in onCreate, but since that's not known, everything fails


Emulate / spoof stack traces - requires call stack in context or similar
  new-instance v1, Ljava/lang/Exception;
  invoke-direct {v1}, Ljava/lang/Exception;-><init>()V
  invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/Exception;->getStackTrace()[Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;

  invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;->getMethodName()Ljava/lang/String;
  move-result-object v2
  invoke-direct {v0, v2}, Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;-><init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V
  invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;->getClassName()Ljava/lang/String;

  invoke-static {}, Ljava/lang/Thread;->currentThread()Ljava/lang/Thread;
  move-result-object v2
  invoke-virtual {v2}, Ljava/lang/Thread;->getStackTrace()[Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;


Fail stories:
  * inner classes are not always resolved properly, should add tests for this, look at base64$coder

Success stories:
  * java -jar simplify/build/libs/simplify-0.1.0-all.jar -i 6247332 -it 'Configs;-><clinit>'
  * java -Xmx6g -jar simplify/build/libs/simplify-0.1.0-all.jar -i 7958300/smali -it '/smv;'
  * java -jar build/libs/simplify-0.1.0-all.jar -i sandbox/8748278/ -it Acgt -v



remove array data payloads that are unreferenced
  Obfuscated example does this in reflected field lookups

what if?
  get stack trace, first element
  from inside a method that's being optimized from main
  the call stack *should* be ambiguous
  but if it's not, could give away it's being virtually executed
  *get first element would be a string, that would get constantized during optimization


wasRegisterRead unit test possibility!
# make sure v0 is not removed
const/4 v2, 0x5
invoke-static {v2}, Ljava/lang/Integer;->valueOf(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;
move-result v0
move-object v1, v0
invoke-static {v1}, Ldoes/not/exist;->howdy(Ljava/lang/Integer;)V

# make sure v0 IS REMOVED
const/4 v2, 0x5
invoke-static {v2}, Ljava/lang/Integer;->valueOf(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;
move-result v0
invoke-static {v2}, Ljava/lang/Integer;->valueOf(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;
move-result v1
invoke-static {v1}, Ldoes/not/exist;->howdy(Ljava/lang/Integer;)V



look for all instanceof unknownvalue, replace with isUnknown if possible

tests for binary math op
2 * different types (int, long, etc) tests - lhs or rhs unknown makes unknown int for int ops


test fill array data payload by making sure it creates bytes, ints or longs or whatever is needed

fillednewarrayop should handle partial unknown

test switch works for integer, short, byte, etc. types


assumeMaxUnknown for invokeop wont work for LocalInstance.isInitialized == false, add tests
boolean isInitializing = methodDescriptor.contains(";-><init>(") && ((value instanceof UninitializedInstance));

new-array op looks buggy when determing if it's local. input smali should override framework.

LocalTypes should not need to contain what kind of type they are?

test aput for non-Number values, e.g. boolean and character into an int array, but see if dalvik handles it properly first


simple test
  throw an exception and catch it

inheritence test
  throw a child exception and see if caught by exception parent

complex inheritence
  throw a child exception, catch parent and grandparent and make sure parent handles

finally test
  simple value set + test

unhandled exception + finally test
  throw exception but make sure finally value set

handled exception + finally test
  throw exception, handle it, make sure finally value set


consider unit testing
  exceptionhandlerresolver - build unit with public method to resolve addresses given an
    exception
    current address
    try catch blocks


catch unhandled virtual exceptions in invokeop
set THOSE as the exceptions, clear children, return
make notes saying that just because eomething is unhandled doesn't mean if there's an actual context for a method instead of just starting it at the root then it might be a handled exception
